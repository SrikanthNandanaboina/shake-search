# ShakeSearch

Welcome to the Pulley Shakesearch Take-home Challenge! In this repository,
you'll find a simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in
the complete works of Shakespeare.

You can see a live version of the app at
https://william-shakespeare-search.herokuapp.com/. Try searching for "Hamlet" to display
a set of results.
